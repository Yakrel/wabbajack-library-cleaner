# Wabbajack Library Cleaner

A tool to clean up old mod versions from your Wabbajack downloads folder, freeing up disk space.

## üí° The Problem

When a modlist updates, Wabbajack downloads new mod versions but keeps the old ones. Over time, you end up with multiple versions of the same mods eating disk space.

Many users keep their downloads folder because they don't have Nexus Premium - re-downloading everything would be slow and painful. But this leads to bloated folders with duplicate versions.

This tool scans your downloads folder, identifies duplicate mod versions, and removes the old ones while keeping the newest.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note:** 
- Not all modlists use the newest mod versions. There's a small chance you might delete a version that's actually needed.
- Always run the dry-run preview (option 1) first to see what will be deleted.
- If a needed version gets deleted, you can re-download it from Nexus.
- Close MO2/Wabbajack before running this tool.

## Ô∏è Mod File Naming Convention

The tool recognizes Wabbajack/Nexus Mods file naming:

```
ModName-ModID-Version-Timestamp.extension
```

Example:
```
Alternate Perspective-50307-4-0-3-1731841209.zip
‚îú‚îÄ Mod Name: Alternate Perspective
‚îú‚îÄ Mod ID: 50307
‚îú‚îÄ Version: 4-0-3
‚îî‚îÄ Timestamp: 1731841209 (Unix timestamp)
```

## üìù Logging

All operations are logged to timestamped log files:
```
wabbajack-library-cleaner_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.log
```

Example log entries:
```
2025/10/28 10:56:59 [INFO] Scanning folder: F:\Wabbajack\Skyrim
2025/10/28 10:56:59 [INFO] Found 498 mod groups with duplicates
2025/10/28 10:56:59 [INFO] Skipped 9959 files (non-standard naming or meta files)
```


## üîß Technical Details

### Supported Archive Formats
- `.7z`
- `.zip`
- `.rar`
- `.tar`
- `.gz`
- `.exe`

### Performance
- Fast scanning
- Low memory usage
- Single executable, no dependencies

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**"File is locked" error:** Close Mod Organizer 2 and Wabbajack before running

**Many files skipped:** This is normal - the tool automatically skips `.meta` files and files with non-standard naming patterns. When a mod archive is deleted, its `.meta` file is also automatically deleted.

**No duplicates found:** Your folder is already clean!

**Accidentally deleted a needed version:** You can re-download it from Nexus Mods
